## Remote Controlled Robot Powered By C.H.I.P (Controller / front end part)

Your task is to build controller software / front-end for controlling the robot built by another group.
Use API built and documented by the another group. Provide controls for moving and performing tricks with the robot. Stream the camera feed to your front-end.

Choose well suiting platform and technology for your controller application, for example Android or web.

Focus on:
- Providing working controls for the robot
- Stream the camera to your front-end
- Documentation so that others are able to test the robot aswel
